Capstone Project: Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom
1. Business Problem
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges in the telecom industry. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High churn not only results in revenue loss but also increases marketing and acquisition costs.

Goal:
- Predict customers most likely to churn.
- Identify major drivers of churn.
- Recommend actionable strategies for churn reduction.
2. Data Understanding
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Rows: 7,043 customers
- Features: 21 (Demographic, Services, Billing & Account Info)
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Key Variables:
- tenure: How long a customer has stayed with the company
- Contract: Type of contract (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year)
- InternetService: DSL, Fiber optic, or None
- TechSupport, OnlineSecurity, DeviceProtection: Add-on services
- MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges: Billing amounts





3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn Distribution: 26.5% of customers churned (imbalanced target).
 
- Contract Type vs Churn: Month-to-month contracts have highest churn rate.
 
- Monthly Charges vs Churn: Higher monthly charges are linked with churn.
 
- Tenure vs Churn: Customers with low tenure (<12 months) churn more.
 
- Tech Support vs Churn: Customers without tech support churn more.

EDA Summary: Customers on flexible contracts (month-to-month), high billing, and no tech support are more likely to leave.
4. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (e.g., TotalCharges with median).
- Converted categorical variables â†’ one-hot encoding.
- Scaled numerical variables (MonthlyCharges, Tenure, TotalCharges).
- Performed stratified train-test split (80-20) to handle class imbalance.
5. Model Building & Evaluation
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	81%	0.70	0.55	0.84
Decision Tree	78%	0.65	0.60	0.76
Random Forest	84%	0.72	0.62	0.86
Gradient Boosting
 	85%	0.74	0.64	0.88
6. Best Model Selection
Gradient Boosting Classifier was chosen as the final model due to:
- Highest ROC-AUC = 0.88 (best discriminatory power).
- Best Recall (important since identifying churners is crucial).
7. Feature Importance
1. Contract type (month-to-month)
2. Monthly charges
3. Tenure
4. Internet service type (fiber optic)
5. Tech support availability
8. Business Recommendations
- Contract Plans: Provide incentives for customers to shift to annual contracts.
- Pricing Strategy: Create lower monthly charge plans for high-risk customers.
- Customer Support: Provide free or discounted tech support & security services.
- Loyalty Programs: Introduce rewards/discounts for customers with tenure < 1 year.
- Targeted Retention Offers: Special offers for senior citizens and high-bill customers.
9. Conclusion
Built a churn prediction model with 85% accuracy & ROC-AUC = 0.88 using Gradient Boosting.
Identified major churn drivers (contract type, charges, tenure, service availability).
Provided actionable business recommendations to reduce churn and increase customer retention.
